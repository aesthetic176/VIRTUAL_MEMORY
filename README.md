# VIRTUAL_MEMORY
It is operating system project

Limitations of programs : LRU and FIFO - We are not displaying which page is replaced in the output of the program.
Translator - We are translating the loical to physical address but we are not displaying the exact page numbers of contents of it.

What is different in our paper : wed id implementation of translation and FIFO and LRU and compared virtual memory with virtual memory and explained page replacement algos with examples by taking a sample string. and also we explained the methodology of the code implementation inside the paper.

What all papers you reffered and what is there in it : 1. Page replacement algos in detail, 2. Demand paging is there in detail, 3. Comparisons between different memories. 4. Having Terminologies regarding Demand Paging.

Challenges : We were new to the C language so we had to get in touch with the language which took a reasonable amount of time.

what will you improve if you get more time ; remove the limitations
